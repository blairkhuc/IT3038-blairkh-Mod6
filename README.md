# User Account Management Script

## Overview

This Bash script provides a simple command-line interface for managing user accounts stored in a CSV file. It allows you to create, display, and delete accounts easily. Each account consists of a unique account name and a randomly generated password. This tool is useful for anyone needing to generate random passwords for their accounts.

## Features

- **Add Account**: Create a new account with a unique name and a securely generated password.
- **Display Accounts**: List all existing accounts and their associated passwords.
- **Delete All Accounts**: Remove all accounts from the CSV file.
- **Delete Specific Account**: Remove a specified account from the CSV file.
- **Password Generation**: Automatically generates a strong password based on user-defined criteria (length and character types).

## Why It Is Useful

Thinking of unique passwords is tedious.This script simplifies the process by allowing you to:
- Generate strong, random passwords, reducing the risk of weak passwords.
- Keep all account information organized in a CSV file for easy access and management.
- Quickly delete or display accounts as needed, making it an efficient tool for both development and administration.
